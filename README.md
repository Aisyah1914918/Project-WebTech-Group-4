# Project Description

‘Extreme Rabbit’ is a website designed and developed to display the details about several types of extreme sport activities in Malaysia. Basically, this web page will display all the details about several types of extreme sport activities in Malaysia such as types of activities, price to pay for the activities, contact number of the business owner and not to forget the location. This website development is aimed to make it easier for anyone who loves extreme sports but is not aware where those places are located because sometimes those kinds of activities are in unsung places. In addition, this website will indirectly advertise the businesses and the state could be tourists’ attractions.
  
Our goals for this project are to successfully create a website that is organized and neat with the correct HTML, CSS and Javascript language code. Other than that, this website development aims to deliver information along with a beautiful picture to the users. Additionally, this project aims to maintain the 8th goal of the Sustainable Development Goals which is Decent Work and Economic Growth where it will help our economic growth when there are a lot of people visiting those places. Our group aspired to create a user-friendly and minimalist interface to avoid the users from being confused. Moreover, our website planned to use a nude or pastel colour and a readable font to give the users warm and calm feelings when they visit our website to find information. 

Next, there will be an FAQ page which stands for Frequently Asked Questions. It serves as a central reference for locating answers to common questions. This page basically will provide a list of answers to common questions about the details about desired extreme sport activities generally. A form with Javascript features is used in this form and is provided to the users if there are no questions that are related to what they want to ask. With the FAQ page, users can find the answer without needing to email the company. This can indirectly save time for both the website developer and the end users. Lastly, we will also provide a section for users to contact us or to give us an idea or feedback about the website at the bottom of the home page because as stated above, we want to develop a user-friendly website hence we are open to any suggestion or critics for us to grow bigger and do better.

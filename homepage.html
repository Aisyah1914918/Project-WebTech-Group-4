		<p><strong>Mountain Biking</strong><p>
		<p>Mountain biking is a sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over rough terrain, usually using specially designed mountain bikes. Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain, such as air or coil-sprung shocks used as suspension, larger and wider wheels and tyres, stronger frame materials, and mechanically or hydraulically actuated disc brakes. Mountain biking can generally be broken down into five distinct categories: cross country, trail riding, all mountain (also referred to as "Enduro"), downhill, and freeride.</p>

		<p><strong>Flyboard</strong><p>
		<p>Flyboarding is an extreme water sport in which athletes compete using equipment called flyboards. A flyboard can be best described as a personal water craft fitted with a water jetpack/hoverboard. Flyboards were invented rather recently by a French watercraft rider in the Autumn of 2012, and was introduced to the world during the 2012 jet ski World Championship in China. It quickly became popular among water sport enthusiasts which led the way to a competitive sport to be developed out of it.</p>
